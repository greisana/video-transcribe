## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#90CAF9), offering a sense of calm and reliability.
- Background color: Soft, desaturated blue (#E3F2FD), creating a subtle contrast.
- Accent color: A slightly more saturated, analogous blue-violet (#7986CB), to draw attention to key interactive elements.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts will ensure timestamps and descriptions are easily read.
- Use minimalist icons for video controls and timestamp actions.
- A split-screen layout, with the video on one side and timestamps on the other, is recommended.
